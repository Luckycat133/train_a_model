# Processor Changelog

## [v2.4.0] - 2024-04-18
### ‚ú® Feature Enhancement (Pre-training Data Quality Improvement)

- **Logging System Optimization**: Refactored logging system with color differentiation and more detailed timestamp format.
- **Error Handling Improvement**: Enhanced error handling mechanism with more context information for debugging.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized batch processing flow to reduce memory usage.

## [v2.4.0] - 2024-04-17
### ‚ú® Feature Enhancement (Pre-training Data Quality Improvement)

- **Implemented PII Redaction**:
    - Integrated `presidio` library (`presidio-analyzer`, `presidio-anonymizer`) for detecting and redacting Personal Identifiable Information.
    - Replaced the placeholder `pii_redactor` function in `processor.py` with the actual implementation using Presidio.
    - Utilized `spacy` models (e.g., `en_core_web_lg`) to support PII detection.
    - Added PII redaction configurations (enable toggle, entity list, redaction method, replacement tag, Spacy model) to `config/config.yaml` and command-line arguments.
    - Updated `requirements.txt` to include `presidio-analyzer`, `presidio-anonymizer`, and `spacy`.
- **Implemented Harmful Content Filtering (Infrastructure)**:
    - Added `check_harmful_content` function in `processor.py` to determine if text is harmful (currently includes placeholder logic, pending model/API integration).
    - Incorporated this filtering step into the `clean_text` workflow.
    - Added harmful content filtering configurations (enable toggle, model path, confidence threshold) to `config/config.yaml` and command-line arguments.
    - Updated `requirements.txt` to include `transformers` (if not already present or version needs update).
- **Implemented Enhanced Quality Filtering**:
    - Added more sophisticated quality filtering rules within the `clean_text` function in `processor.py`.
    - **Length Filtering**: Added a maximum length limit (`max_length`).
    - **Language Detection**: Use `langdetect` or `fasttext` (optional) to filter out text not in specified languages.
    - **Repetition Detection**: Calculate n-gram repetition rates to filter out overly repetitive text.
    - Added relevant configurations (enable toggle, min/max length, symbol ratio, language filter toggle, allowed languages, detection method, fasttext model path, repetition filter toggle, n-gram size, repetition threshold) to `config/config.yaml` and command-line arguments.
    - Updated `requirements.txt` to include `langdetect` and `fasttext-wheel`.

### üóëÔ∏è Removed Features
    - Removed harmful content filtering functionality and related configurations.
- **Dependencies & Configuration**:
    - Updated `requirements.txt` to include all new dependencies (`chardet`, `beautifulsoup4`, `colorlog`, `inquirer` were also added for other functionalities).
    - Updated `config/config.yaml` by adding a `cleaning_rules` section to centralize all cleaning and filtering options.
    - Refined the logic in `processor.py` for merging command-line arguments and configuration file settings.

## [v2.3.7] - Planned
### Feature Enhancement (Pre-training Data Quality Improvement)

- **Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Redaction**: Plan to add mechanisms to detect and remove/replace sensitive personal information (e.g., names, addresses, phone numbers).
- **Harmful Content Filtering**: Plan to integrate functionality to identify and filter out harmful, inappropriate, or offensive content.
- **Enhanced Quality Filtering**: Plan to introduce more refined quality filtering rules (e.g., based on sentence length, symbol ratio, repetition ratio) or models to filter low-quality text.
- **Punctuation Handling Adjustment**: Plan to review and potentially adjust the punctuation handling logic, leaning towards preserving punctuation crucial for semantic understanding.

## [v2.3.6] - 2025-04-11
### Feature Optimization & User Experience Enhancement

- **Command-Line Arguments**: Improved `argparse` help messages using `ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter` and argument groups for better clarity.
- **Progress Bar**: Enhanced `tqdm` progress bar format (`bar_format`) to provide more detailed feedback (e.g., remaining time, processing rate) during file reading and batch processing.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error logging during file reading and preview, now including specific exception types for easier debugging.
- **Logging Setup**: Made the `setup_logging` function more robust by adding exception handling and logging configuration details.
