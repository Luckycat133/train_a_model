# Project Overview

[English](./project_overview.md) | [中文](../project_overview.md)

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive large language model training framework, providing end-to-end solutions from data preprocessing to model training. Through modular design, each component can be independently developed and optimized while maintaining good extensibility.

## Core Components

### Data Processing
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Data format conversion
- Quality control and filtering

### Tokenization System
- Custom tokenizer training
- Multi-language support
- Dictionary management and optimization

### Model Training
- Distributed training support
- Mixed precision training
- Training process monitoring

### Evaluation System
- Performance metrics evaluation
- Result visualization
- Error analysis

## Technical Features

1. **Modular Design**
   - Independent functional modules
   - Clear interface definitions
   - Easy to extend and maintain

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient data processing
